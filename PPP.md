# 1. Problem

### What problem am I solving?

- Multiple paid cloud and streaming services
- Data spread across platforms and devices
- Privacy concerns
- Limited customization

### Why important?

- Lower cost over time
- More control
- Private + secure
- Hands-on systems learning

---

# 2. Project Focus (Team / Topic)

## Software-focused project

Using home server hardware to build:

- Self-hosted applications
- Personal cloud storage
- Media streaming
- Secure remote access
- Monitoring & automation


---

# 3. Two Learning Topics (with AI)

## Software Topic
### Docker & Linux Server Administration
- containers
- service orchestration
- networking
- reverse proxy configuration

---
## Hardware Topic
### Server Monitoring & IoT Integration
- sensors (temps/health) 
- ESP32 → server communication
- system monitoring

AI assists learning & troubleshooting

---

# 4. Time Usage Plan
### Iteration 1 → Learn
- Ubuntu Server basics
- Docker fundamentals
- networking & proxy concepts
- security practices
### Iteration 2 → Build
- Deploy Nextcloud and Jellyfin
- Configure remote access
- Add monitoring tools
- Organize media services


---

# 5. Features

### MVP
