# csc494-smart-media-server
Smart Home Media System is a home media server platform built on Ubuntu Server that streams media and hosts multiple applications using Docker. The system is designed to support expansion with monitoring, automation, and smart home integrations while serving as a centralized home infrastructure server.


# Smart Home Media System

## Project Overview
The Smart Home Media System is a centralized home media server platform built on Ubuntu Server. The goal of this project is to provide a reliable and scalable home server for streaming media and hosting self-hosted applications using Docker. The system is designed to act as a core piece of home infrastructure, supporting media services, file synchronization, remote access, and future smart home and monitoring integrations.

This project is being developed as part of CSC 494 and will evolve over multiple stages, starting with a functional media server and expanding to include automation, monitoring, and optional IoT integrations.

## Core Technologies
The system is built using the following core technologies:

- **Ubuntu Server** as the main operating system
- **Docker** for containerized application hosting
- **Nextcloud** for file storage, sync, and sharing
- **Cloudflare Proxy** for secure remote access and traffic routing
- **Namecheap Domain** for custom domain and DNS management

---

## Planned Features
The following features are planned for this project:

- Media streaming services hosted on the home server
- Docker-based deployment and management of services
- Nextcloud for personal cloud storage and file sharing
- Secure remote access using Cloudflare proxy services
- Custom domain management through Namecheap
- Centralized server management and service orchestration

---

## Additional Components
In addition to core server functionality, the project will explore the following components:

- **DVD ripping and media ingestion**
  - External DVD drive integration
  - Automated ripping and media organization
  - Importing ripped media into the media library

- **Monitoring and system health (future expansion)**
  - Resource usage tracking
  - Server status monitoring
  - Optional environmental or system sensors

---

## MVP (Initial Scope)
The minimum viable product (MVP) for the initial phase includes:

- Ubuntu Server fully configured
- Docker installed and managing core services
- Media streaming service deployed
- Nextcloud deployed and accessible
- Domain and Cloudflare proxy configured for remote access

---

## Future Expansion
Future stages of the project may include:

- Advanced monitoring and alerting
- Smart home and automation integrations
- AI-assisted system analysis and optimization
- Additional self-hosted services

---

## Learning with AI Integration
This project will be supported by a separate Learning with AI repository. AI tools will be used to assist with learning and implementation of topics such as:

- Server and infrastructure security
- Monitoring, logging, and system health analysis
- Containerization best practices
- Network and remote access configuration

Learning artifacts, notes, and reflections will be documented in the Learning with AI repository.

## Project Status
- Repository created
- README drafted
- Initial server configuration in progress
- Core services planning underway
